History of ProTick:
(- note, + added, * fixed)

Version 0.3
- partial rewrite of ProTick.Pas because SP/2 crashed it :(
+ DupeCheck

Version 0.4
+ Hatch

Version 0.5
* silly bug in CompareAddress-function
* some other bugs
+ NewFilesHatch
+ FILES.BBS-Handling

Version 0.6beta1
* some bugs :)
+ MsgBase-Interface
+ Maint
  - delete sent archives
+ DupeCheck via Path
+ made CheckDestination deactivateable
- restructured source code, DOS (DPMI) Version now possible
- now up to 64kb descriptions instead of 256b
- splitted Toss into Toss and Pack
  - several files for one user are packed at a time now
    -> much faster
    - Attention! %F in Packer-definition has changed:
      former: File
      now: ListFile
    - if your packer does not support listfiles, you have to use a tool,
      e.g. LstFor (LSTFOR.ZIP at 2:2435/424):
      Packer=1,LZH,LstFor %F LH32 a %A !F
      You should not use such packers because it is much slower.
- changed key structure
  - registered users got new key

Version 0.6beta2
* bug in parser (Section: FileAreas, KeyWord: Announce (since announce is not
  implemented yet, this is not important))
* bug in forwarding procedure causing PT to crash when receiving files
  in a area without connected users

Version 0.7beta1
* bug in SendTIC mixing up adresses
* bug in Files.BBS-Handling: if no Files.BBS existed, SetDesc was aborted
  instead of creating a new one.
* bug in Files.BBS-Handling: if a Files.TMP existed it was appended instead
  of overwriting it.
* bug in Files.BBS-Handling: added <DescPos> spaces before
  every char instead of every line
* bug in NewFilesHatch (I HATE compilerbugs)
+ Announces
- made key more secure
  - registered users got new key
  - old versions (0.6x) also run with new key

Version 0.7beta2
* bug in Scan: points are now identified correctly again
* from is now in every TIC
+ origin-address in Hatch

Version 0.7beta3
- changed TIC names from '<8 hex letters>' to 'PT<6 hex letters>'
+ everything below tearline is ignored
+ everything below %quit is ignored
+ if DelReq is set to yes, areafix requests will be deleted
+ if DelRsp is set to yes, areafix requests will be set to Kill/Sent
+ DelReq, DelRsp config option
+ everything below %note is ignored, areafix request will not be deleted.

Version 0.7beta4
* missing comma in announce-definition of autocreated areas
* AreaDesc was not initialized after each TIC

Version 0.7beta5
* when OriginAddress was set via cmdline parameters, zone was set to 0
* path for autocreated areas could contain spaces
* descriptions of announced files were shifted too far
* some bugs in handling of description of announced files
+ LocalPwd config option
  former behaviour: password of TICs from one of your AKAs was ignored
  now:              password of TICs from one of your AKAs is compared
                    with the one set as LocalPwd. Hatch will automatically
                    use it, if you set ToAddress _and_ FromAddress to
                    one (or two) of your AKAs.

Version 0.7beta6
* ALL filefix requests were killed
* listed systems with wrong password could autocreate areas
+ added some messages to request processing

Version 0.7beta7
* small password bug (since beta6)

Version 0.7beta8
+ NewAreas.PT (list of autocreated areas)
+ Areas.Log (list of processed areas)

Version 0.7beta9
* when trying to connect a area without downlinks via filefix, a GPF occured

Version 0.7beta10
* small bug in address parsing (since beta9)

Version 0.7beta11
* small bug in directory naming for autocreated areas: if the last substring
  was longer than 8 characters, ProTick did a endless loop

Version 0.7beta12
- archives are now named like FlowFiles
  (out\domain.001\00010001.pnt\00000001.c00 instead of out\zone\00010001.c00)

Version 0.7beta13
* updating files on a CD is now possible (changed DelFile(FileArea) +
  MoveFile(InFile, FileArea) to ReplaceFile(InFile, FileArea))

Version 0.7beta14
* NewFilesHatch now works

Version 0.7beta15
* several bugs in ConnectArea / DisConnectArea (filefix)
+ %Query (filefix)

Version 0.7beta16
* few small bugs not appearing with SP/2 and BP but with VP/2
* small bug in address parsing: a point address without domain was not parsed
  correctly

Version 0.7beta17
- changed maximum size for domains from 8 chars to 12 chars (fidonet.org)
- changed some internal structures to lower sizes
  Attention: structure of ArcList has changed. Run "ProTick Pack" before
  updating!

Version 0.7beta18
- renamed ProTick.Cfg in release archives to ProTick.Cf_
- changed structure of KeyFile. Please get new keys from me.

Version 0.8beta1
* Maint now also deletes files in domain and point outbounds
* caught some exceptions in message handling (file open exceptions)
* memory hole (18060 Byte)
* Addresses in AnnounceGroups had last character / digit missing
* OS/2 only: Announces were not indented
* Announce: Files from different file areas got mixed up
* trailing/leading spaces in areafix requests are now ignored
* filefix area-connect-requests were case-sensitive
* bug in path-parsing causing some TICs to be erroneously treated as dupes
* changed SIZE in TICs from hexadecimal to decimal
* changed UnixDate in PATH from decimal to hexadecimal
+ switch LongDirNames: (dis)allow directory names > 8 chars
+ DispLevel
+ MsgID in FileFix responses and announces
  Note: ProTick searches (and creates if it does not exist) a MsgID sequence
  file in the directory declared in the environment variable "MSGID" or
  if that is not defined in the Path where the config file is.
+ Exit with errorlevel:
    0 no errors
    1 No commandline parameters
    2 unknown commandline parameter
    3 config incomplete
    4 no configfile found
    5 could not open logfile
    6 could not open ARC.LST
    7 could not access DFUE.DLL
    8 protick.bsy found
    9 could not open PT.LST
+ PassThrough
  Attention: Do NOT run ProTick Maint BEFORE ProTick Pack! Otherwise some
  passthrough-files can get lost!
+ ArcAddr (TICs have destination address <addr> but are sent to <ArcAddr>)
+ AreaFix: %UNLINKED (send list of disconnected areas)
+ longname support: if "longname: " is the first word in Desc or LDesc[1], it
  will be copied to LongName.Lst as "<Directory>,<shortname>,<longname>".
  LongName.Lst is a textfile, so you can link <shortname> to <longname> on your
  own.
+ MaxDupeAge: DupeBase-entries older than <maxdupeage> days are purged
+ BBSArea=<bbsarea>, BBSArea.Log: For every fileare you may define a
  corresponding name for the area in the BBS which will be written to
  BBSArea.Log (similar to Areas.Log). If not defined, the areaname will be
  used.
+ OwnAddr: use origin address <ownaddr> for TICs to the user
  Address priority:
  OwnAddr -> AreaAddr -> destination address of TIC arrived -> none
- Attention: structure of ArcList has changed. Run "ProTick Pack" before
  updating!
- Attention: structure of DupeBase has changed. Delete "ProTick.Dup" before
  updating!
- changed display format (now looks like Log)

Version 0.8beta2
* wrong address was displayed when sender of TIC was not connected to the
  area and at least one user was connected to the area
+ writing FILES.LNG in every area
  format of FILES.LNG:
  <shortname> <longname>
+ evaluating archiver errorlevel
  (found and fixed bug in SP/2 causing errorlevel 7 to be returned instead
   of errorlevel 0)
+ TicOut: TICs are placed in TicOut instead of primary outbound
+ Linux version
- CRCs are now logged in hex format
- many changes for Linux version, especially converting filenames and hex
  letters to lowercase

Version 0.8beta3
* LongDirNames was "Yes" as default
+ made SplitDirs deactivatable
  split up areanames into several directories, e.g. linux_node becomes
  linux\node
+ made filename of areas.log and bbsarea.log configurable
  if not set, they are created in the same directory as the configfile
+ made filename of msgid.dat configurable
  if not set, msgid.dat is looked for in %MSGID% and the directory of the
  configfile
+ made filename of protick.dup configurable
  if not set, protick.dup is created in the same directory as the configfile
- protick.cfg is now looked for in the following directories:
  current directory, %PT%, /etc/fido (Linux) / c:\fido (DOS / OS2)
  protick.key is looked for in these directories:
  current directory, directory of the EXE (DOS / OS2 only), %PT%,
  /etc/fido (Linux) / c:\fido (DOS / OS2)

Version 0.8beta4
* if CRC-checking was disabled for an area, the CRC of the file was not
  calculated but nevertheless it was checked
* if no passthrough-path is set, PT will exit
+ added passthrough-path to sample configs :)
+ CreateDirs creates important directories if they do not exist

Version 0.8beta5
* TICs are now in CRLF-format (TICs created by the Linux version were LF only)
+ made filename of longname.lst configurable
  if not set, longname.lst is created in the same directory as the configfile
+ made filename of newareas.pt configurable
  if not set, newareas.pt is created in the same directory as the configfile
+ made filename of arc.lst configurable
  if not set, arc.lst is created in the same directory as the configfile
+ made filename of pt.lst configurable
  if not set, pt.lst is created in the same directory as the configfile

  the files sent to him.
- Attention: structure of ArcList has changed. Run "ProTick Pack" before
  updating!
- changed key structure to make it portable
  Please get a new key!

Version 0.8beta8

* DescPos could not be set to 0
* Squish-Netmailarea should work now (found workaround for a bug in MKMsg,
  thanks to Sven Bursch!)
+ LDescChar
+ AddDLCount
+ DLCountDigits

Version 0.8beta9
* linked areas in user definitions are now case-insensitive
* moving across devices (inbound on one partition, areapath on another
  partition) now possible under Linux (YACB - Yet Another Compiler Bug)
- ignoring CRs and LFs in configfile
- ATTENTION: Squish-NM-Area does NOT work under Linux right now (although
  said to work in Version 0.8beta8), rewrite of either MKMsg or my functions
  needed to fix that. I probably will use smapi instead of MKMsg in future
  versions.

Version 0.8beta10
* moving across devices should now be possible at last (YACB)

Version 0.8beta11
* files.bbs-handling: workaround for a bug in fpc causing too long
  descriptions
+ OBType
+ experimental support for FD STQ
- Linux only: DirUMask, FileUMask (permission mask to use for created
  directories and created/changed files)
  Attention: not used for message areas (Netmail area, announces)

* added many typecasts to circumvent YACB causing sporadic core dumps under
  Linux
* had to rewrite some for-loops because of a bug/feature in fpc
* not using unit CRT under Linux anymore, sporadic segfaults while directly
  writing to console (without redirection) should be gone now
- only using bogus delay-routine to wait for locked files
+ added allfix2protick-converter to linux-version

Version 0.8beta13
* INTL-Kludge now correctly written in FileFix mails
* SegFault in Linux version if no To-address was specified in TIC
* removing FileName and DLC from files hatched by NewFilesHatch
* SegFault on empty (L)Desc-Lines
- if no matching address with zone matching the recipient of a FileFix
  response is found, the first address is used now (former: last address)
- filefix-names now match whole words (former: substrings) 
+ added support for netmail-announcegroups (keyword "Type")
+ using OwnAddr also for FileFix
+ SingleDescLine
+ Group in %LIST
