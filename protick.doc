1. Introduction
---------------

   ProTick is a so-called Ticker. It reads TIC-files and processes the
   associated files following the information in the TIC. For a description
   of the structure of these files, please read FSC-0028 (available as
   FSC-0028.ZIP at 2:2435/424).
   It still is in the beta-stadium, that means there may be many bugs
   and not everything will work. If you experience problems or find bugs,
   please contact me (see chapter 4).


1.1. License
------------

   ProTick is MAILWARE. That means, you just have to write me a mail (EMail
   or NetMail, see chapter 3) and you'll get a key.
   I just want to know who uses ProTick and if it's worth to continue
   developing it.
   Of course it runs without a key, it just writes "unregistered" instead
   of your serial number into the TICs.


1.2. Features
------------

   Just some of them:

   - Text-Config
   - FileFix
   - NewFilesHatch
   - Announces
   - List of autocreated areas (NEWAREAS.PT)
   - List of processed areas (AREAS.LOG, BBSAREA.LOG)
   - long directory name support
   - FILES.LNG (List of 8.3-files and the corresponding long names) parallel
     to FILES.BBS
   - complete domain support
   - (un-)packing of TICs and Files
   - Passthrough
   - LogLevel and DispLevel customizable
   - Errorlevel evaluatable
   - ArcAddr (TICs have destination <Addr> but are sent to <ArcAddr>)
   - OwnAddr (set our address for each user)
   - nearly everything customizable

2. Configuration
----------------

   The file "protick.cf_" contains a sample configuration for your operating
   system. We'll discuss only the DOS configuration, but everything said
   is also true for the other versions unless stated otherwise.

   The configuration file is called "protick.cfg" and looked for in the
   following directories:
   current directory, %PT% (under Linux: ${PT}), /etc/fido (Linux) / c:\fido
   (DOS, OS/2), directory where the EXE is located (DOS, OS/2)

   The key file is looked for in these directories:
   current directory, directory of the EXE (DOS / OS/2 only), %PT% (Linux:
   ${PT}), /etc/fido (Linux) / c:\fido (DOS / OS/2)

   Entries in protick.dup that are older than <MaxDupeAge> days are removed.

>  AreasLog=%DFUE%\pt\areas.log

   Location of the list of processed areas (that is, areas where new files
   have arrived).

>  BBSAreaLog=%DFUE%\pt\bbsarea.log

   Similar to AreasLog, but instead of the "real" areanames the names
   specified in the BBSArea-Field of the areas are used. Useful if the
   areas have a different name in the BBS (Example: Area "nodediff" is
   called "Fido.nodediff" in BBS).
   It can be used to compile the FILES.BBS' with FB if you use Maximus
   (see FBPPT.CMD in the OS/2 version).

>  MsgIDFile=%DFUE%\msgid.dat

   This file contains the first available MsgID. Please set it to the
   same file in all programs, otherwise every program would generate
   own MsgIDs resulting in false dupes!

>  DupeFile=%DFUE%\pt\protick.dup

   Location of the DupeList. Every file that arrives gets an entry in this
   file and if it arrives a second time (due to problems at your uplink)
   it is not processed again.

>  LongNameLst=%DFUE%\pt\longname.lst

   Location of the longname-list. If a file with a "longname:" in the
   first line of the description arrives, the short name (the filename
   of the file), the long name (everything after "longname:") and the
   directory of the area will be written to this file. Every line is an
   entry with the following structure: "<Directory>,<shortname>,<longname>".

>  NewAreasLst=%DFUE%\pt\newareas.pt

   This is a list of autocreated areas.

>  ArcLst=%DFUE%\pt\arc.lst

   If files and/or TICs for a DownLink are to be packed, they first
   get an entry in this file. Later, when you call "protick pack", they
   are packed into the archives.

>  PTLst=%DFUE%\pt\pt.lst

   PassThrough-Files are listed in this file. If such a file is sent to all
   downlinks and all TICs are deleted, it will be killed by "protick maint"


>  [MGRNAMES]
>  MgrName=FileFix

   ProTicks FileFix processes mails directed to any name listed in this
   section (whole word has to match) and to one of your addresses.


>  [ARCNAMES]
>  ArcName=*.c0*,0

   If a file with the name specified is found, it will be unpacked with
   the specified unpacker. If you set the unpacker to "0", every unpacker
   will be tried (or the unpacker "0" will be used if it exists)


>  [GROUPS]
>  Group=1,General

   In this section the group names are defined. The names are used e.g. by
   %LIST. ProTick itself only uses the numbers. They start at 1 (you may
   begin with a higher number, but you must not use 0).


>  [ANNOUNCEGROUPS]

   Now it's getting complex. But don't worry, it's easier as it looks like. :)
   Here you define the AnnounceGroups. If an area is in such an announcegroup,
   a mail will be written into a message area saying which files have arrived.
   The numbers start at 1.

>  Group=1,PB.Ann.All Fido

   This starts the definition of a group. The name is currently not used.

>  Area=S%DFUE%\Echo\PB\AnnAll

   The message area where the mail will be written. See "Netmail" in the
   "General"-section.

>  Subj=Fido

   The mail will get this subject.

>  From=%SysOp%, 2:2435/424@fidonet

   The sender of the mail will be set to this.

>  To=All, 2:2435/424@fidonet

   And that's the recipient of the mail

>  Type=Echomail

   The mail is posted to an Echomail area. An origin line is generated,
   the Pvt flag will NOT be set.

>  HeaderFile=/husky/cfg/protick.ann.hdr

   The content of this file is put in front of the mail

>  FooterFile=/husky/cfg/protick.ann.ftr

   Similar to HeaderFile, it is appended to the mail


>  [PACKER]

   Let's define the packers!

>  Packer=2,ZIP,ZIP -0jD@ -b %Tmp% %A < %F

   The first part is an index used in the "ArcNames" section and the "Users"
   section. The second part is the name used by the FileFix if a user
   changes his packer. The last part is the call. "%A" will get replaced by
   the archive name and "%F" by a file containing a list of the files
   which shall be packed into the archive.
   The numbers start at 1.


>  [UNPACKER]
>  UnPacker=1,LZH,LH32.EXE e %A %D /o

   Similar to Packer. Instead of "%F", "%D" is the directory where the
   files shall be unpacked to.
   If an unpacker with the number 0 is defined, it will be used as GUS
   (General Unpack Shell). See also [ARCNAMES] section.


>  [ADDRESSES]
>  Addr=2:2435/424@fidonet.org

   Your addresses.

>  [DOMAINS]
>  Domain=fidonet.org,fidonet

   If a domain is longer than 8 characters and/or contains a dot, it must
   be mapped to a directory name in the outbound.
   In this example the domain is "fidonet.org", but the directory is named
   "fidonet".

>  [FILEAREAS]

   Now to the fileareas. :)

>  Area=AutoCreate:0

   The name of the area.
   An area with the name "AutoCreate:<group>" defines the defaults for areas
   autocreated in group <group>.

>  BBSArea=<name>

   This is the name written to BBSArea.Lst (see "BBSAreaLog" in
   "General"-section)

>  Desc=Area autoadded

   Description of the area.

>  Path=%dfue%\files

   Path to the area.

>  MoveTo=%dfue%\files\old

   Old files (files replaced by new files) are moved to this directory. If
   this path is not specified, the files will be killed.

>  ReplaceExt=

   Incoming files also replace files with this extension (may contain
   wildcards).

   Example:
   ReplaceExt is set to "ZIP", the incoming file is "ABC.RAR".
   If the file "ABC.ZIP" exists, it will be killed.

   Useful if you convert archives.

>  Group=1

   The group this area belongs to.

>  Announce=1,16

   Incoming files are announced in these areas, see "AnnounceGroup"-section.

>  Level=30

   Downlinks with a lower Level than this cannot connect to this area
   via FileFix.

   NoPause              Files are sent to Downlinks even if they are
                        set to passive
   Hidden               does not appear in arealist (FileFix %LIST)
   PassThrough          files are only passed through (to downlinks) but
                        not stored locally

>  LastHatch=<(last date NewFilesHatch was executed) as Unix-TimeStamp (Hex)>

   The last date NewFilesHatch was executed (Hex-Unix-TimeStamp)

>  Groups=1

   He/She may connect to the areas in these groups.

>  Level=30

   But only to areas with a level smaller than or equal to Level.

>  Mail=Normal

   Hold, Crash, Direct).

>  Pwd=XXX

   The password (used in TICs and for FileFix).

>  Sends=Yes
>  Receives=Yes

   If he connects to an area via FileFix, the area will get these options
   (see below).
